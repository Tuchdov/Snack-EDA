# Snack-EDA

The US Department of Agriculture maintains a rich dataset of food products and their detailed ingredients,
called FoodCentral Data or FDC. Each food product is branded, categorized and analyzed for the nutrients
it is made of. There are over 300K food products listed, divided to dozens of categories, of which over 70K
are snacks.

In our dataset there are ~35K snacks products (train and test combined), in 6 categories:
• Popcorn, Peanuts, Seeds & Related Snacks
• Candy
• Cookies & Biscuits
• Chips, Pretzels & Snacks
• Chocolate
• Cakes, Cupcakes, Snack Cakes

And the data contains 3 datasets:
1. food_train.csv and food_test.csv
2. nutrients.csv
3. food_nutrients.csv

In this course final project I did an EDA in the form of a *market research* from the Data.
